# 🤖 Artificial Intelligence Lab 1 — Maze Search & Python Foundations

This repository contains the code and notebooks for **Lab 1** of the Artificial Intelligence course.  
It includes:
- a guided introduction to Jupyter and Python basics,
- hands-on exercises with NumPy, Matplotlib, Pandas, Seaborn,
- and an applied project: building and solving randomly generated mazes using search algorithms like BFS, DFS, and A*.
